    org.bluetooth.characteristic.percentage_8
  description: This property represents the weights applied to measured values reported by individual sensor probes in a sensor that consists of 6 probes to reflect their relative importance to the overall result.
  mapping:
    description: This property has 7 fields, each of which derives its value from the characteristic. These fields are shown in the following table.
    caption: Mapping from property fields to characteristic fields

        characteristic: Percentage 8
    additional_description: |-
      The Steps field represents the number of steps available when configuring the Weight N fields.
      Each Weight N field represents a weight used by the sensor when calculating the weighted output value. Weights do not need to add up to 100%.
