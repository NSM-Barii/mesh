characteristic:
  identifier: org.bluetooth.characteristic.cooking_zone_perceived_power
  name: Cooking Zone Perceived Power
  description: |-
    The Cooking Zone Perceived Power characteristic is used to represent the percentage of nominal power as perceived by the associated cookware device (i.e., the percentage of the maximum amount of heat that is delivered to the cookware device compared to when nominal power is applied). 
    For some types of appliances such as gas or coil cooktops, this percentage corresponds to the percentage of output power. For induction cooktops, the perceived power and the amount of heat received by the cookware device depend not only on the output power but also on the frequency and other parameters applied by the induction element.
    For cooking appliances that support boost mode where the cooking zone can temporarily deliver more than the nominal power, the Cooking Zone Perceived Power can be more than 100%. 
    The structure of this characteristic is defined below.

        Unit is a percentage with a resolution of 0.1.
        Minimum: 0
        Maximum: 3550
        Represented values: M = 1, d = -1, b = 0
        Base unit: org.bluetooth.unit.percentage
        All other values are prohibited
        1000 corresponds to 100% of Nominal Power
        3550 corresponds to the maximum the cooking zone can supply if it supports 255% boost level
