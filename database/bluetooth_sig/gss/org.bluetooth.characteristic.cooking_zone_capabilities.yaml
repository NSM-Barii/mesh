  name: Cooking Zone Capabilities
  description: |-
    The Cooking Zone Capabilities characteristic is used to represent the properties of a cooking zone (e.g., a burner of a stove, or a chamber of an oven). 
    The structure of this characteristic is defined below.
  structure:
    - field: Flags
      type: boolean[16]
      size: "2"
      description: See \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.cooking_zone_capabilities/field/flags}.
    - field: Power Technology
      type: uint8 
      size: "1"
      description: See \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.cooking_zone_capabilities/field/power_technology}.
    - field: Number of Cooking Steps
      type: uint16
      size: "2"
      description: Number of cooking steps that can be programmed for the execution in the cooking zone. Value 0 indicates that the cooking zone does not support execution of the control loop.
    - field: Nominal Power
      type: struct
      size: 0 or 3
      description: |-
        Maximum power level that the cooking zone can deliver to the cookware device on a constant basis (i.e., boost mode power is excluded). 
        Structure of the field matches the Power characteristic in \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.power}.
        Present if bit 1 of Flags field is set to 1
    - field: Boost Level
      type: uint8
      size: 0 or 1
      description: |-
        The Boost Level identifies the increase in power as percentage of Nominal Power that can be delivered during a finite period.
        Minimum: 0
        Maximum: 255
        Unit: org.bluetooth.unit.percentage
        Value 0 means that the cooking zone has no boost capability.
        Value 100 means that the cooking zone can supply an additional 100% on top of the nominal power.
        Present if bit 1 of Flags field is set to 1
    - field: Minimum Available Power
      type: struct
      size: 0 or 2
      description: |-
        In some implementations, there is a limit on the total amount of power that a cooking appliance can deliver to all the cooking zones. This field specifies the percentage of nominal power that the cooking appliance can deliver to this cooking zone regardless of other conditions.
        Structure of the field matches the Cooking Zone Perceived Power characteristic in \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.cooking_zone_perceived_power}. 
        Present if bit 1 of Flags field is set to 1
    - field: Maximum Temperature
      type: struct
      size: 0 or 2
      description: |-
        In devices controlled by the temperature settings (e.g., ovens or refrigerators), this value indicates the maximum temperature that can be set.
        Structure of the field matches the Cooking Temperature characteristic in \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.cooking_temperature}.
        Present if bit 2 of Flags field is set to 1
    - field: Minimum Temperature
      type: struct
      size: 0 or 2
      description: |-
        In devices controlled by the temperature settings (e.g., ovens or refrigerators), this value indicates the minimum temperature that can be set.
        Structure of the field matches the Cooking Temperature characteristic in \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.cooking_temperature}.
        Present if bit 2 of Flags field is set to 1
    - field: Maximum Blower Fan Airflow
      type: struct
      size: 0 or 2
      description: |-
        Maximum blower fan airflow for the cooking zone.
        Structure of the field matches the Kitchen Appliance Airflow characteristic in \autoref{sec:org.bluetooth.characteristic.kitchen_appliance_airflow}.
        Present if bit 4 of Flags field is set to 1
  fields:
    - name: Flags

      description_header: Description      
      values:
        - value: "0"
          description: If set to 1, then the cooking appliance supports aggregation, and this cooking zone can be aggregated with another cooking zone
        - value: "1"
          description: If set to 1, then the cooking zone can be controlled by setting a power level (e.g., in cooktops)
        - value: "2"
          description: If set to 1, then the cooking zone can be controlled by setting a target temperature (e.g., in ovens)
        - value: "3"
          description: If set to 1, then the cooking zone supports setting the humidity (steam) level
        - value: "4"
          description: If set to 1, then the cooking zone supports setting the blower fan airflow
        - value: "5"
