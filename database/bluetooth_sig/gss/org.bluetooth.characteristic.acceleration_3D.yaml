characteristic:
  identifier: org.bluetooth.characteristic.acceleration_3d
  name: Acceleration - 3D
  description: |-
    The Acceleration - 3D characteristic represents a measure of acceleration with a limited range.
    A stationary object on Earth's surface experiences an Acceleration - 3D of 1 g\textsubscript{n} in the downward direction, perpendicular to the surface, due to Earth's gravity.
    The structure of this characteristic is defined in the following table.
  structure:
    - field: Vector X
      type: sint8
      size: "1"
      description: |-
        Unit is a standard acceleration due to gravity with a resolution of 0.01 g\textsubscript{n}.
        Minimum: -1.28
        Maximum: 1.25
        Represented values: M = 1, d = -2, b = 0
        Unit: org.bluetooth.unit.standard_acceleration_due_to_gravity
        A value of 0x7E represents 'out of range'.
        A value of 0x7F represents 'value is not known'.
    - field: Vector Y
      type: sint8
      size: "1"

        A value of 0x7E represents 'out of range'.
        A value of 0x7F represents 'value is not known'.
    - field: Vector Z
